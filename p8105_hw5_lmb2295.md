This is my submission for the fifth homework assignment for P8105.

# Problem 2: Longitudinal study data

First, I created a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants,
including the subject ID, arm, and observations over time from the
original folder of .csv files.

``` r
control_exp_df = 
  map_df(list.files(path = "./data", full.names = TRUE), read.csv) %>% 
  mutate(file_name = list.files(path = "./data")) %>% 
  relocate(file_name, .before = week_1) %>% 
  separate(file_name, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id", "delete"), sep = "\\.") %>% 
  select(-delete) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, 'con' = "control")) %>% 
  mutate(arm = recode(arm, 'exp' = "experimental"))
```

Then, I made a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over
time by week.

``` r
control_exp_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    names_prefix = "week_",
    values_to = "value"
    ) %>% 
  unite(group, arm:id, sep = '', remove = FALSE) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = value, group = group, color = arm)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    title = "Measurement for Control vs Experimental Arm Over Time",
    x = "Week",
    y = "Value") +
   theme(legend.position = "right")
```

While measurements for the variable of interests were comparable at
baseline for the control and experimental groups, values increased over
time for the experimental group, but not for the control group. There
was considerable inter- and intra-individual variability in both groups.
